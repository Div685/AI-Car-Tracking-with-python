# AI Car And Pedestrain Tracking with python OpenCV

> AI car and pedestrain Tracking built with Python and openCv library. The Project file has demo video but you can replace with your own video by just replacing `ped_car_Trim1.mp4` file with your own video. 
- when the Tracker runs it will show two different color boxes. 
- The one with pink color indicates pedestrain
- The one with green color indicates cars.
