# AI Car And Pedestrian Tracking with python OpenCV
 
> AI car and pedestrian Tracking built with Python and openCv library. The Project file has a demo video but you can replace it with your own video by just replacing `ped_car_Trim1.mp4` file with your own video.
- when the Tracker runs it will show two different color boxes.
- The one with pink color indicates pedestrian
- The one with green color indicates cars.
